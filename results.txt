There we learn some agents are conducting an op, but just like recent DOA shows like Citadel and Fubar, trained agents are speaking on their \"secret\" coms openly among crowds of people. Worse, they are further risking exposure by extending those exchanges into casual conversations about (insert unimportant topic).\n\nThen something goes wrong with their remote computer access (which also never makes sense), yet no one on the team seems alarmed that they might have been discovered and cut off. Instead they casually seek another way to access the network.\n\nBesides the fact secure networks don't broadcast a signal through which they can be hacked, even if that was a thing the team would have already had an alternate plan in place.\n\nAdding to the dumbness, the \"hacker\" needs to be within ten feet of the head security guy for... reasons, but the rest of the team opposes the plan because she's \"not a field agent\". Uh, they are all in a foreign country operating from a van parked outside the resort. That's the field. If she was merely a computer tech she'd be at their headquarters since their concern seems to be her lack of field training, even though she's in the field.\n\nIt's a shame moronic garbage has become the norm.",

The marketing is so ready to brag that it's the executive producers of Dead Reckoning but this makes every wrong decision that film didn't make.\n\nIt's dull, it's derivative, it's forgettable and somehow even worse than all of the previous attempts to get a spy franchise going from Netflix (please don't let this get a sequel). Every CGI action set piece is bad, lacking any weight and is only laughable opposed to thrilling.\n\nGal Gadot is definitely capable of leading something like this but Rachel Stone is such a boring character with no depth and spends most of the film refusing to connect or open up which only makes it worse. Jamie Dornan is way better though, he's allowed to have fun with it whilst everyone else is overly serious.\n\nWhilst Tom Harper really can't direct action scenes the film generally looks more vibrant than something like The Gray Man and avoids the excessively grey colour palette for 90 minutes at least. The music by Steven Price feels like it belongs to a completely different movie but definitely sounds like a better movie.",

Stupid story, silly dialogue, poor performance and lame action scenes. They had an Indian character, just to make it more diverse.

CGI Stunts especially bad made CGI stunts look so much worse than real stunts and this is a huge problem when one of the best action spy movies with some of the most impressive stunts ever made, MI 7, is running in cinemas at the same time. Really bad timing. This movies isn't anywhere as good as MI 7 but maybe I expected a little too much.\n\nAlso I rarely watched a movie where the music annoyed me but this one manages it. The Music ruins so much scenes.\n\nIf this movie was really thought to be the beginning of an entire franchise Netflix should have put some more effort into it, but at the end the real factor that decides if there will be more movies is the money not the quality, sadly.",

      "reviewText": "Unfortunately \"Heart of Stone\" is another poor Netflix production. I am now giving up on all Netflix produced films as I was made physically ill from this film due to the flashing, frame rate, shaky camera, overexposure, and direct lights into the camera. These very poor production qualities terminally sink this film, along with most other Netflix films. I am sad that there are virtually no good films being made today. While I like Gal Gadot, she could not save this poor production and its poor script. There really should be warnings on these films for people with certain illnesses. I had heart palpitations from this film and had to fast forward and stop it. The 4k frame rate, not resolution, of 50-60 frames per second is hard on the body and should be banned by the FCC. Filmakers, please go back to 24 frames per second and no filters, good scripts, tripods, good sound mixing, etc. I'm tired of this garbage being put out there. And 1080p resolution on DVD is perfectly fine, no need to mess with it. Instead, cameramakers and the FCC are pushing this 4k standard even onto broadcast television. It will all soon be unwatchable for me as I have a neurological condition. I will have to watch only old DVD's. And there are too many commercials on tv anyway, some programs are sped up to fit more in. In closing, if you don't have Netflix and want to see something comparable to this film, just stare at a fluorescent light tube for an hour and you'll get the same experience. 1/10 rating, obviously avoid, rewatch any James Bond instead.",

It's not my favourite spy thriller of all time or anything, but it's better than a lot of them.\n\nIt's not the smartest spy thriller, but by the same token, it's also not actively trying to outsmart the audience. There's twists, but they don't come out of nowhere and everything more or less makes sense given the general flow of the movie. I think this is probably going to end up being one of the more contentious points for this movie because people are probably expecting it to be like a James Bond movie, but this is one or two tiers down the intelligence totem pole.\n\nThe action scenes aren't the best ever made, and I wouldn't even argue they're the best action sequences in a movie this year. However, they're not bad, either. The tension is there, Gal Gadot's character never gets a free pass and has to struggle to win, and they all further the plot. So while the action scenes aren't exactly groundbreaking, they're also well constructed and well executed.\n\nIn terms of acting, this is probably the best dramatic performance Gal Gadot has ever given. While she's always been a better action actress than a dramatic one and probably always will be, I wouldn't be too surprised if this ends up being remembered as one of her better performances overall.\n\nAll in all, Heart of Stone is a good movie. Nothing about it is amazing, but it all gets a solid B. I think most of the people giving it a low score have set their expectations too high.",

Were there impressive and expensive sets and locations? Did Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot deliver the high-octane convincing action? Absolutely yes to all. Especially when you consider the latest A-list female lead action films that have come out lately, such as The Mother with J-Lo, and Ghosted with Ana de Armas, that were all disappointing and cringeworthy flops.\n\nAnd let's be honest, as cliched, generic and predictable as this was, it's not far off from the same tropes and use of \"AI will rule the world in the wrong hands\" theme in the latest Mission Impossible, of which was my least favorite of that franchise. Sure Tom Cruise did his own stunts jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle, so more props to him and less to Gadot for all her impressive action scenes that were stunt-doubles or computer generated - in the end, the wow factor is equally still there in the action department.\n\nBut both films suffered the same generic cliched writing, this one has just a little more cheese in it's dialogue and writing, but at least it didn't have a Part 2 cliffhanger. I gave M. I. an 8/10, and feel very comfortable giving this one with similar action and similar writing, but not as good directing a 7/10, mostly all going to Gadot for being the first female lead in this genre to convince me she needs to be in this franchise. Hopefully if there are more Stone films to come, there will be better filmmakers attached to them.",

I'm not a fan of the all-knowing data projections either, because life is about making choices. Gal Gadot's a fine lead choice, beautiful and such, but the character has little depth. Keya lifts the villain to power, but then is his foil as well. Building up something, just to knock it down, that's not great writing in my opinion. No particularly memorable moments, the best of which is Rachel with the initial team. Little bit PC.",

Just skip past the netflix bashers and the 'critics' out to get some of the actors.\n\nThe storyline is pretty thin, but it checks out and has enough in it for some decent action. Acting is more than fair and the stunts and their photography are good.\n\nAs a spythriller it has the same credibility issues as the next one, including MI. Of course it does, that's why it's called fiction.

Perhaps she should stick to posing glamorously on social media and selling her own brand Mac n cheese!!! She is not a leading lady. WW 1 and 2, Red Notice, etc were all awful.

I'm rather surprised by the low rating on here as I thought it was an entertaining two hours.\n\nAction for most of the time is at break neck speed and the plot is relatively easy to follow. The actors can be heard for a change and lacks the current fashion for mumbling which I hate. I think it's better than the last Bond movie \"No Time To Die\" and miles ahead of \"Wonder Woman 1984\".\n\nThe cinematography is great and often panoramic. I'm no expert in the technology of modern movies but it looked just as good as any Marvel, Star Wars or other fantasy flick to me.\n\nThese films are mostly the same anyway, heroes and villains carrying out ridiculously impossible feats so just go along for the ride. The writing is not great but some jokey one liners have always been thrown in to these since the early Bond days.\n\nGal Gadot has the charisma to carry a film and I thought Jamie Dornan was quite good and less bland than he's been up to now. He's starting to look a bit like Colin Firth as he gets older.\n\nA fun two hours well directed by Tom Harper I thought.",

Soon however, her secret gets discovered, and she must choose between the two teams.\n\nThe action starts off with a scene involving Stone skiing down a mountain with a parachute. After that, the thrills continue, with riding on motorcycles, fighting in snow and free falling out of a plane.\n\nGadot portrays Stone as being loyal to her friends, she goes to save them, even though she knows it will blow her cover. MI6 was unaware of her fighting abilities, until Stone rescues them in a fight at their hotel. Keya Dhawan (Alia Bhatt) teams up with another spy, in hopes in getting revenge on the people who killed her parents.\n\nThe only stunts Gadot preformed herself was all the fighting, which was very impressive. Her stunt double did things like skiing down a mountain with a parachute or free falling, which was an incredible thing to do since it looked dangerous. George Steel, who did the Cinematography actually shot on location. He captured beautiful scenes including one in the snow, which was filmed in Iceland.
